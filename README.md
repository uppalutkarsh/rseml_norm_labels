### Overview

In our work, we address the trade-off between the accuracy and calibration potential of a classification network. We integrate normalization to label smoothing crossentropy
loss, allowing cost function to impede network’s over-confidence, refine calibration, and enhance the model’s performance and uncertainty capacity.
